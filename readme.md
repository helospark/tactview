## Build

### Dependencies


 - FFmpeg (AVCodec)
 - OpenCV
 - Java 15
 - Apache Maven (for building)
 - ImageMagick


On Linux you can install all dependencies with `tactview-native/build_dependencies.sh` + you also need to install Java 15, Maven
On OSX `tactview-native/build_dependencies_mac.sh` + you also need to install XCode, Java 15, Maven

### Release build


Create a release

	./create-release-{platform}.sh

You will find the created releases in `release` folder under. The created zip can be copied to and run on a different computer, as it already contains almost all shared libraries and dependencies and only a minimal set of shared libraries are used on the platform where it is run.

### Development

 - Get all native dependencies, on Linux you can do that by running `tactview-native/build_dependencies.sh` as root
 - You need to build all native code by running `build.bat (Windows)`, `build.sh (Linux)`, `buildmac.sh (Mac)` script in `tactview_native`. You need to do this every time you modify native code (which should be rare). 
 - You can import `tactview-parent` into your IDE as a Maven project.
 - Run `HackyMain` class as Java application with these arguments `-Djdk.gtk.version=2  -Xmx4g -Dprism.order=sw  -Dtactview.profile=development`
